## Project
### Dijkstra's algorithm implementation
The result of the given program is an application that finds the shortest path between two points in a maze thanks to Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm was studied in INF101. The program was implemented by following the TD/TP specifications. 
 
### Result 
The application allows the user to :
 *Import a maze from a text file and display it
 *Export a maze to a text file
 *Edit an interactive maze 
 *Find the shortest path between two points in a maze
